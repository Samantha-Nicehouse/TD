# TreasureDetector
This app is for metal detector treasure hunting enthusiasts to track their discoveries. The purpose of this app is to replace pen and paper documentation. Now treasure hunting enthusiasts can list their findings, take pictures, and document their search locations in one place. This app is both for beginners and seasoned adventurists. Metal detectors have improved over the last 30 years but not the way we document our adventures. This app does not have metal detection or reading capabilities.
